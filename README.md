Developed the web application at HackForChange Hackathon that connects the Farmer with the Digital World. In this, the farmer has to register one time and fill all the necessary details like land size, crops, weather conditions, etc. After registration, farmer will be notified about all the next stage details on his mobile phone. After the crops will be ready, the farmer will be suggested with real market price of cereals. The price will be calculated according to market price and the freshness scale.
